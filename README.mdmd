## About Dataset
IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.

As of December 2020, IMDb has approximately 7.5 million titles (including episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database,[2] as well as 83 million registered users.

IMDb began as a movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.

# Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset
Simulated Credit Card Transactions generated using Sparkov
## About the Dataset
This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

## Source of Simulation
This was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format.

## Information about the Simulator
I do not own the simulator. I used the one used by Brandon Harris and just to understand how it works, I went through few portions of the code. This is what I understood from what I read:

The simulator has certain pre-defined list of merchants, customers and transaction categories. And then using a python library called "faker", and with the number of customers, merchants that you mention during simulation, an intermediate list is created.

After this, depending on the profile you choose for e.g. "adults 2550 female rural.json" (which means simulation properties of adult females in the age range of 25-50 who are from rural areas), the transactions are created. Say, for this profile, you could check "Sparkov | Github | adults_2550_female_rural.json", there are parameter value ranges defined in terms of min, max transactions per day, distribution of transactions across days of the week and normal distribution properties (mean, standard deviation) for amounts in various categories. Using these measures of distributions, the transactions are generated using faker.

What I did was generate transactions across all profiles and then merged them together to create a more realistic representation of simulated transactions.

Brandon Harris for his amazing work in creating this easy-to-use simulation tool for creating fraud transaction datasets.

# SMS Spam Collection Dataset
Collection of SMS messages tagged as spam or legitimate

## About Dataset
## Context
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

## Content
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

This corpus has been collected from free or free for research sources at the Internet:

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is: [Web Link].
-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The NUS SMS Corpus is avalaible at: [Web Link].
-> A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at [Web Link].
-> Finally, we have incorporated the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. It has 1,002 SMS ham messages and 322 spam messages and it is public available at: [Web Link]. This corpus has been used in the following academic researches:

## Inspiration
Can you use this dataset to build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam?
